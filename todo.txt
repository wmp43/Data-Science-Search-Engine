High to Low priority
1. Built out effective query visualization class for both chunks and articles.
    - I had a good way to do this before but currently forget.
    Query Bar: What is deep learning
    Language model response: Depp learning is ...
    Search Response: table of relevant articles
    Visualization:
        1. chunk visualization with metadata
        2. article visualization idk if we have metadata for this


2. Langauge model whether its chatgpt api or sagemaker deployment needs to be done.
    - This needs to be implemented in inference_apis.py
    - Current call will be placed as method under Query.QueryProcessor.call_language_model()
3. Implement gliner for ner


Notes:
Hyde can be used for query expansion. It is really asking lm answer with no ground truth, then embed lm res, then find similarity measures.
